## 🌳 Vision

Computer programming is one important ability necessary for scientific research.
It is not only useful in data analytics and simulations, but also helpful to
automate and streamline our daily tasks, make things faster and easier. It is
changing our world.

I hope we share whatever ideas, codes, tips and so on here to make our world
better.

Would you like to buy me a coffee? I would really appreciate it if you could
