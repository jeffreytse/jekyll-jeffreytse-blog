## Howdy! I'm JT.

This is a very personal blog. I don't write blogs for anyone, but just
record what I do or what I think.

I am a self-motivated and largely self-taught professional who likes to
dig deep into problems and architect elegant solutions.

When I am not at the keyboard, you will likely find me surfing or lounging
on the beach with a good book.

If you are interested in knowing more, read my articles or take a look
at my pictures.
