Welcome! This is my personal website. I don't write blogs for anyone, but just
blog what I have learnt or thought in my daily life.

I am a self-motivated and largely self-taught professional who likes to
dig deep into problems and architect elegant solutions.

When I am not at the keyboard, you will likely find me surfing or lounging
on the beach with a good book. If you are interested in knowing more, read my
articles or take a look at my pictures.
