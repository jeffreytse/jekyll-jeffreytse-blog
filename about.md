Welcome! This is my personal website. I don't write blogs for anyone, but just
blog what I have learnt or thought in my daily life.

I am a self-motivated and largely self-taught professional who likes to
dig deep into problems and architect elegant solutions.

When I am not at the keyboard, you will likely find me surfing or lounging
on the beach with a good book. If you are interested in knowing more, read my
articles or take a look at my pictures.

I also develop and maintain open-source projects that boost developer
productivity. In addition, I practice playing piano and guitar in my spare
time. Besides that, I also fall in love with photography. Welcome to exchange
ideas with me.

Roadmap: 👨‍💻 -> 🎸 -> 🎹 -> 📸

Here are some of my open-source projects:
