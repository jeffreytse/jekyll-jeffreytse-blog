Hello everyone 👋

This is my personal website. I don't write blogs for anyone, but just
blog what I have learnt or thought in my daily life.

About me 😄:

- 🧑 0x92 years old
- 🇨🇳 From China
- 👨‍💻 Software Developer
- 🔨 Passionate Technician

Roadmap: 👨‍💻 -> 🎸 -> 🎹 -> 📸

I am a self-motivated and largely self-taught professional who likes to
dig deep into problems and architect elegant solutions.

When I am not at the keyboard, you will likely find me surfing or lounging
on the beach with a good book. If you are interested in knowing more, read my
articles or take a look at my pictures.

I also develop and maintain open-source projects that boost developer
productivity. In addition, I practice playing piano and guitar in my spare
time. Besides that, I also fall in love with photography. Welcome to exchange
ideas with me.

Here are some of my projects:

- [jekyll-spaceship](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship): 🚀 A Jekyll plugin to provide powerful supports for table, mathjax, plantuml, mermaid, emoji, video, audio, youtube, vimeo, dailymotion, soundcloud, spotify, etc.
- [jekyll-theme-yat](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat): 🎨 Yet another theme for elegant writers with modern flat style and beautiful night/dark mode.
- [jekyll-deploy-action](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action): 🪂 A Github Action to deploy the Jekyll site conveniently for GitHub Pages.
