![Taylor Swift - NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvVnP8G6ITs&style=width:100%)

Wow! This is a lot of people in a tiny office!
I love it

I'm Taylor, Welcome to my Tiny Desk
Concert!

Wow It's great to be in DC

You guys...um...how do you think exciting going on last couple weeks?

Any possible changes in play?

Do us a favor : give a round of applause to NPR for putting this whole thing on

Tiny Desk is like one of my favorite corners of the internet...um and I always
love seeing like

it's an opportunity for artists to decide a different way to showcase their music

and so you're kind of inundated by overwhelming opportunity and choices like I was

I just decided to take this as an opportunity to show you guys
how the songs were sounded when I first wrote them

So it's just me...there's no dancers...unfortunately

[Um "chuckle"]

So, you know, I have this album that just came out called LOVER

[cheers]

Real happy you like it

It's one of those albums where I wrote everything on one instrument first, so...

it's really fun to pick songs to do acoustically because they all started out
that way.

Um...and...There's a song that I had wanted to write conceptually for a very
long time, because over the course of my life, it has occurred to me that we
have a bit of a double standard issue in our society

It's something I've thought about 7 hundred million times a day, for the last
10 years of my life and I was always wondering, like...

Can I write a song about this? Is there a concise and catchy way to write a song
about this?

What angle would I take if I were to write a song about this?

And so I decided that the most fun thing to do would be imaging what my life
would be like

And what people would say about my life if I did all the same things

But if I was a man

So...Um

So..Um There's a song that I wrote on the album that I knew as soon as I wrote it
it was going to be the tittle track

Just....And it was like

Writing songs is strange cause it never happens exactly the same way

But sometimes it happens in a way that it feels like this weird
like haunting that you can't really explain

Like you don't know where these ideas came from
and you feel like you don't work at all to write it

And that's the best part - that's the best kind of song...Um

And then there most days, you show up,
and the idea doesn't

And that's where craft you have to kind of know the craft of it, you have to
scrounge your brain for something to write

Because you're not always going to be inspired, and that's okay...um

There's a really good Elizabeth Gilbert Ted Talk about that, it's like...
one of my favorite things to cry while watching

Um, but yeah, like with this song, it was one of those weird moments where I was
just like. Okay this is just middle of the night...

I'm like in my PJs, like stumbling to the piano because I got this idea, and the
song just happened really quickly

There's a line in the song that I'm really proud of...um
and the line says :

With every guitar string scar on my hand I take this magnetic force of a man to
be my lover

And that line is really special to me because um I've spent quite a bit of time
writing breakup songs

And uh...songs about things not turning out the way you wanted them to

Or songs about what you thought would be love and it turned out to be not that at
all or

You know just kind of the struggle of life...I find songwriting is really just a
cathartic therapeutic thing for me

And so there are a lot of things I've written about in life that were just the
harder things I had to go through so

I took that as a metaphor for like...you know the times when I was learning to
play guitar and I'd like

play until my fingers bled when I was a kid And I still have the marks from that

You know all the times I'd be changing a string and it would pop and I still have
scars from that

Um...but it's also a bigger metaphor for like in life, you accumulate scars, you
accumulate hurt

You accumulate moments of you know learning and disappointment, and struggle and
all that

And if someone's gonna take your hand,
they'd better take your hand, scars and all

Um...So this is called LOVER

♪ Lover ♪

♪ We could leave the Christmas lights up until January ♪

♪ This is our place, we make the rules ♪

♪ And there's a dazzling haze ♪

♪ a mysterious way about you, dear ♪

♪ Have I known you twenty seconds, twenty years? ♪

♪ Can I go where you go? ♪

♪ Can we always be this close forever and ever? ♪

♪ You take me out, You take me home ♪

♪ You're my, my, my, my ♪

♪ LOVER ♪

♪ We could let our friends crash in the living room ♪

♪ This is our place, we make the call ♪

♪ I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you ♪

♪ I've loved you three summers now, honey, I want 'em all ♪

♪ Can I go where you go? ♪

♪ Can we always be this close forever and ever? ♪

Thanks guys

You guys ever have costume changes at Tiny Desk?

Um..so...over the course of the years that I've done
interviews...Um...

which is I think probably or years now
Um...

I've gotten a question over and over again that I think has has
like the potential to seriously deteriorate my mental health

Um...The question is, "What will you ever do if you
get happy? What will you write about?"

Will you just never be able to write a song again?

It's an interesting question

Um...and you know in the the interviews, when I would get
that question as a young person

I'd kind of be like, 'Well, I started out writing songs about
stuff I had no idea about

Like I started writing songs when I was years old
and they were usually about heartbreak"

I had no idea what I was talking about, but I had watched
movies and I had read books, so I would grab inspiration from character dynamics, as you do

Um...and so I would say in the interviews, "Oh, I'd probably just do that!"

If stuff is going on in the world that not just happening
to me, like maybe I could get inspiration from that

But then I'd go home and I'd be like : [blank stare]

What would happen if I was ever happy?

Would I not be able to do the thing that I love the most in the
world? Like would that...is that? Oh my...Oh my god!

Would I not be able to write breakup songs anymore? I love
breakup songs! They're so fun to write!

Um...and so then I happened to be writing this album Lover, which is a very, very happy, romantic....

Um...album, and I started, like in my life, a few of my friends were going through break ups, and we were talking

it's like the kind of break up where you need to talk to your
friend all the time because they need to talk about it
all day, every day

So I was having a lot of conversations about break ups
I watched movies that were really like:

well-done about break ups, In some of the books
I was reading there were some good break ups happening

And this all culminated in me waking up one day with all these
like heartbreak lyrics in my head and I was like

"It's still here! Yes!"

Um...So I ended up writing a song that was a break up song on the Lover album, and I was like :

This song is my proof that...you know...you don't have to stop
writing songs about heartache and misery

Which for me is incredible news

Thanks guys!

I have three that I don't...

She's giving her guitar picks to kids :
"You can Sell them on eBay"

Um...So...I was trying to think of what songs to do for this
Um...and you get I think four, so I was [excited noises]

And so I was thinking about how it's autumn, and Um...
that's my favorite "Chuckle" season...um
and people on the internet have been kind enough like

in like in amongst the people who care about my music have
been kind enough to associate autumn with one of
my albums called RED

And...Um...You know it's just a very autumn-y album, and
so I was thinking about that how it's so nice
the crisp fall air is happening

and...um ...you know, I don't google myself ever

I recommend you don't do it either

But my dad does! And he will send me links to thinks and
every once in awhile I'll see them, and that's
the only way I get my news

Um...But he sends me these lists that are like very nice
...um...like ranking my songs, that's really nice for people to do

I really love that people do that and I find it really nice and
I'm grateful that people care enough to rank my songs

There's one song that like I'm particularly proud of because
when the RED album came out there was this one song on the album where I was like

I'm the only one who loves this song this much,
but it's only because it happened to me, it was personal

No one else is going to like
"All Too Well" as much as like

And when it came out of the album, slowly but surely over
the course of that album's life and beyond

You know you guys have made that song something that was way more than I ever thought the life of that song would be

and like I've had so much fun playing it in concert and screaming it with you guys like and yeah

So the fact that the song went out into the world so you
make it so it's always

I think it's usually number # on any list saying what my songs are, which is great

and I'm happy that like my opinion lines up with your opinion
on that because that was probably my favorite song on RED

Um...and so I figured that I would play it for you

Before I do play it for you, I just wanted to say thank you so much for having me, this is really amazing to get to do this

I'm honored that I was invited, and the fact that this many
people would want to cram into the space

I really I understand the sacrifices that were made for me today

So...Um...here's a sad song...about fall

♪ All Too Well ♪
From RED ALBUM

♪ I walked through the door with you,
the air was cold ♪

♪ But something 'bout it felt like home somehow ♪

in your drawer even now ♪
