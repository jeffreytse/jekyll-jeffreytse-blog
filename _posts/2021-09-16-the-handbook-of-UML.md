UML is an open method for specifying, visualizing, constructing and writing
an artifact of an object-oriented, software-intensive system under development.
This article is a guide for us to learn this important tool in software
engineering.

## Models

- Functional Model: Shows the functionality of the system from the user's
  perspective, including use case diagrams.
- Object model: uses concepts such as objects, attributes, operations, and
  associations to display the structure and foundation of the system, including
  category diagrams and object diagrams.
- Dynamic Model: Shows the internal behavior of the system. Including sequence
  diagrams, activity diagrams, state diagrams.
