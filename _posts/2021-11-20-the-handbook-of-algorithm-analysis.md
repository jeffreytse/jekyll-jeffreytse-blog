It is very common for programmers to compare their programs or algorithms
with one another. When two programs solve the same problem but look
different, is one program better than the other? Here is a handbook to
help us do the algorithm analysis.

## Analysis Dimensions

- Time
- Space

## Analysis Method

We use the "Big-O Notation".

Here is some common algorithm complexities:

- O(1)
- O(log n)
- O(n)
- O(n log n)
- O(n^2)
- O(2^n)
- O(n!)
