Reductions are reduced forms of English words. Reductions, such as `wanna`,
`gonna`, are not real words in English. Contractions are words or phrases
that have been shortened by dropping one or more letters, such as `I'm`,
`You're`, etc. We need to know reductions and contractions in order to sound
more natural and understand conversations between native English speakers.

## Reductions

- cuz = because
- coulda = could have
- dontcha = don't you
- frunna = in front of
- gimme = give me
- gotta = have got to, also means I understand what you said
- gonna = go to (Americanism)
- hafta = have to
- imma = I am going to
- kinda = kind of
- lemme = let me
- lotsa = lot of
- outta = out to
- sorta = sort of (Americanism)
- shoulda = should have
