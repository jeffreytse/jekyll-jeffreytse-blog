Beginning with an exploration of everyday base words and affixes, this post
will show how to apply your knowledge of these patterns to the multisyllabic
English words of Latin origin, and its potential to enhance vocabulary
skills. You will discover why and how the roots of English have led to the
belief, albeit unjustified, that the English spelling system is awkward and
contradictory.

## Pattern

prefix-root-suffix

- Root: original meaning
- Prefix: emphatic, direction or size
- Suffix: property, meaning (sometimes)
- Phonological change:
  - letter: vowel + consonant
  - vowel: a, e, i , o, u (e.g. rest/rust, shirt/short)
  - semivowel: y, w (e.g. yes/fly)
  - function: hyphen (i,u is the most common use) and no meaning
  - consonant: pronunciation is similar, and they can be replaced
    - voiced: suffix is often for verb (d,t,s)(e.g. scribe)
    - voiceless: suffix is often for noun or adjective (e.g. script)
  - sound laws in the Indo-European languages:
    - Grimm's law
    - Verner's law
    - Winter's law
    - b = p = m = f = v (e.g. fin/pin/pen)
    - g = k = c = h (e.g. glue/clue, horn/corn)
    - m = n = l = r (e.g. sum/sol, moon/lun, palm = `p` + `arm`, bank = `bar` + `k`, desert = `de` + `sand`)
    - d = t = s = c = th (e.g. dent/teeth)
    - u = v = w
    - y = i (e.g. crisis = `cry` + `sis`, crime = `cry` + `me`)

The first three are the most important. Pronunciation change in English does
not change its meaning, just extend in meaning, such as `vinc` and `vict`,
they both mean winning, conquer.

80% of English vocabulary comes from foreign languages, and most of them are
Latin, French, Germanic.

- Latin: university, library
- French: beef (English call cow), pork (English call pig)
- Germanic: machine, automatic
- Greek: democracy, liberty
- Japanese: tofu (Chinese, 豆腐), sensei (Chinese, 先生)，senpai(Chinese, 先辈)
- Chinese: katchup (Cantonese, 茄汁), kowtow (Cantonese, 叩头), lychee (荔枝),
  typhoon (台风), mandarin (满大人)
- ...

English has a history of 2,300 years. In the course of historical development,
its meaning will be gradually extended.

English thinking:

- Synecdoche: concrete things are often used to extend or represent the whole thing
  - bar(barrier) to represent the
- Doubly consonant: British English often uses doubly consonant, American
  English often uses single consonant
  - traveller, traveler
