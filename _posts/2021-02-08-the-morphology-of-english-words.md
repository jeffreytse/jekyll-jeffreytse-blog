## Morphology

prefix-root-suffix

- Root: original meaning
- Prefix: emphasize, direction or size
- Suffix: property, meaning (sometimes)
- Phonological change:
  - letter: vowel + consonant
  - vowel: a,e,i,o,u
  - semivowel: y,w
  - function: hyphen (i,u is the most common use) and no meaning
  - consonant: pronounciation is similar, and they can be replaced
    - voiced: suffix for adverb (d,t,s)(e.g. comprehend)
    - voiceless: suffix for noun or adjective (e.g. comprehend)

The first three are the most importan. Pronounciation change in English does
not change its meaning, just extend in meaning, such as `vinc` and `vict`,
they both mean winning, conquer.

80% of English vocabulary comes from foreign languages, and most of them are
Latin.

English has a history of 2,300 years. In the course of historical development,
its meaning will be gradually extended.
