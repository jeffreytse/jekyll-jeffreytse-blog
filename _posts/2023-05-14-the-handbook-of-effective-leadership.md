## Leadership Approaches

How can I become a more effective leader? One of the most important aspects of
being a good leader is understanding different leadership approaches and when
each approach is most likely to be effective will help you succeed.

6 leadership approaches:

- Visionary: Share a vision and motivate the team
- Collaborative: Foster ideas or agreement from the group
- Directive: Tell employees what to do
- Pacesetting: Inspire by example of commitment and hard work with self-awareness
- Affiliative: Build connection and closeness with empathy in the team
- Coaching: Provide instruction or coaching

### Visionary

A visionary leader fosters trust and respect by bringing people together toward
a common vision and a focus on the end goal. Visionary leadership aligns and
motivates others, then gives them freedom to develop specific ways to reach the
shared goal. This approach is at the core of effective leadership.

__When to use it:__ This approach is appropriate when staff donâ€™t need lots of
guidance.

__Things to consider:__ This approach assumes that staff have or can gain the
necessary knowledge and skills to take action to meet the shared goal.

### Collaborative

A collaborative leader involves the staff in contributing to the decision-making
process.

__When to use it:__ This leadership approach is useful when there is time to get
input from employees or when employee buy-in is needed.

__Things to consider:__ This approach can be slow moving and is not the best
choice for when a decision needs to be made quickly. This approach also depends
on how well informed the employees are about the situation.

### Directive

A directive leader takes charge and tells employees what to do.

__When to use it:__ This leadership approach works in times of crisis, when there
is little time to act, or when employees have less skill and experience with the
needed work.

__Things to consider:__ If this approach is used too often or in situations
where it is not a good fit, it can be overbearing and cause employees to feel
resentful.

### Pacesetting

A pacesetting leader sets high performance standards and leads by example.
Leaders using this approach communicate their expectations to others through the
model shown by their own actions.

__When to use it:__ This is a good approach when the staff are highly motivated
and skilled and when there is a tight deadline.

__Things to consider:__ If this approach is used too often by itself, it can
cause the staff to feel burned out and may suppress motivation.

### Affiliative

An affiliative leader establishes positive relationships and works to create
strong emotional bonds with employees. This leadership approach focuses on the
employees and on creating a sense of ownership of and belonging to the business.

__When to use it:__ This approach works well in times of stress, as part of a
healing process, to build or rebuild trust, or when bringing in new staff or
building a new team.

__Things to consider:__ This approach should seldom be the only approach used.
While it's important to have positive relationships with employees, other
leadership approaches are needed to ensure that appropriate actions are taken
when necessary. If negative behaviors or poor performance is ignored, this can
encourage mediocre behavior.

### Coaching

A coaching leader focuses on mentoring employees and building their strengths
and skills for the long term.

__When to use it:__ This approach works when the leader is experienced and the
staff need to build their knowledge and skills, and when employees are aware of
weaknesses and receptive to suggestions.

__Things to consider:__ This approach can take a lot of time and is not the best
choice if the leader is not highly skilled in the specific area. This approach
also depends on the willingness of the employees to change or learn and to
cooperate with the leader.

## Effective Communication

What technologies can help us communicate effectively as a leader? Whether you
are running a small business or an international enterprise and regardless of
your leadership approach, effective communication is essential to success. Many
technologies are available to help leaders connect with their employees,
partners, and customers and create channels for two-way communication and
collaboration. The type of technologies you choose depends on the situations and
communication needs at any given time.

This activity is an exercise for you to reflect on how you want to lead your
employees and learn about the different types of technologies that you can
use to communicate with them effectively.

Communication technologies:

- Instant messaging (IM)
- Online community
- Internet voice and video call
