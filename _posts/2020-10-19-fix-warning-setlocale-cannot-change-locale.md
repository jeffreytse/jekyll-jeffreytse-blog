## 1. Introduction

When you are using the terminal and encounter the following warning
promtp like `warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)`,
you can not figure it out and you are most likely confused, this
article would help you solve this problem.

## 2. Solution

```bash
$ sudo locale
```

Edit the configuration file for `locale-gen`:

```bash
$ sudo vim /etc/locale.gen
```

> This file lists locales that you wish to have built. You can find a list
> of valid supported locales at /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED, and you can add
> user defined locales to /usr/local/share/i18n/SUPPORTED. If you change
> this file, you need to rerun locale-gen.

Add or uncomment the locale `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` and rerun `locale-gen`:

```bash
$ sudo locale-gen
```

## 3. Conclusion

This error happens when your terminal settings local locale environment
variables which doesnâ€™t have the specific locale you requested, to solve
this problem you should configure and generate the locales.
