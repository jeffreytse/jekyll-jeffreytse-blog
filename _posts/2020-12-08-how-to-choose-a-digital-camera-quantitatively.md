There are many different criteria for choosing a digital camera. Here we can
use a mathematical method, that is, to score a camera quantitatively, so that
we can roughly compare the quality of different cameras based on the numbers.


## Quantitative Table

- 80 < score <= 100 - **Excellent**
- 65 < score <= 80 - **Very good**
- 50 < score <= 65 - **Can be considered**
- 25 < score <= 50 - **Relatively Worse**
- 0 < score <= 25 - **Extremely Worse**
