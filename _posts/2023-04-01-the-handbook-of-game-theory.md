Game theory is a small branch of mathematics, and it is also a useful subject
in economics, so as to have a systematic understanding of the subject.

## Perfect Information

In economics, perfect information (sometimes referred to as "no hidden
information") is a feature of perfect competition. With perfect information
in a market, all consumers and producers have complete and instantaneous
knowledge of all market prices, their own utility, and own cost functions.

In game theory, a sequential game has perfect information if each player, when
making any decision, is perfectly informed of all the events that have
previously occurred, including the "initialization event" of the game (e.g. the
starting hands of each player in a card game).

Perfect information is importantly different from complete information, which
implies common knowledge of each player's utility functions, payoffs, strategies
and "types". A game with perfect information may or may not have complete
information.

Games where some aspect of play is hidden from opponents – such as the cards in
poker and bridge – are examples of games with imperfect information.

## Complete Information

In economics and game theory, complete information is an economic situation or
game in which knowledge about other market participants or players is available
to all participants. The utility functions (including risk aversion), payoffs,
strategies and "types" of players are thus common knowledge. Complete
information is the concept that each player in the game is aware of the
sequence, strategies, and payoffs throughout gameplay. Given this information,
the players have the ability to plan accordingly based on the information to
maximize their own strategies and utility at the end of the game.

## Incomplete Information

Inversely, in a game with incomplete information, players do not possess full
information about their opponents. Some players possess private information, a
fact that the others should take into account when forming expectations about
how those players will behave. A typical example is an auction: each player
knows his own utility function (valuation for the item), but does not know the
utility function of the other players.

## Decision Tree

Whether you play chess, go, backgammon or other decision-making games, you can
draw a decision tree, they are essentially different in rules and complexity,
because their decision-making steps are limited, theoretically , if we can
traverse all the situations in the decision tree, we can know the result of the
game, win or lose or tie.

Game Complexity can be measured in many ways:

- State-space Complexity
- Game-tree Complexity
- Game-tree Size
- Decision Complexity
- Computational Complexity
- ...

## Zermelo's Theorem

In game theory, Zermelo's theorem is a theorem about finite two-person games of
perfect information in which the players move alternately and in which chance
does not affect the decision making process. It says that if the game cannot end
in a draw, then one of the two players must have a winning strategy (i.e. can
force a win). An alternate statement is that for a game meeting all of these
conditions except the condition that a draw is now possible, then either the
first-player can force a win, or the second-player can force a win, or both
players can at least force a draw.

The theorem is named after Ernst Zermelo, a German mathematician and logician,
who proved the theorem for the example game of chess in 1913.

It tells us that, assuming that both sides are chess masters and know the game
well, they will definitely adopt a unified strategy at this time to make the
game develop in a fixed direction, and the final outcome is also fixed. In the
end, it will definitely be a draw, because Any party that unilaterally changes
its decision will be detrimental to itself.

## Nash Equilibrium

In game theory, the Nash equilibrium, named after the mathematician John Nash,
is the most common way to define the solution of a non-cooperative game
involving two or more players.

In a Nash equilibrium, each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies
of the other players, and no one has anything to gain by changing only one's own
strategy.

It tells us, as long as the strategies of several parties participating in the
game are limited, there must be an equilibrium state, and everyone will adopt
this balanced strategy, and there is no motivation to unilaterally change the
strategy.

## Classic Examples

In general, the optimal strategy is a Nash equilibrium, and Zermelo's Theorem is
an example of a Nash equilibrium. And the world we live in is full of examples
of Nash equilibrium no matter what aspects.
