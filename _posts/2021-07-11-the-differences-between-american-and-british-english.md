There is an old saying that America and Britain are "two nations divided by
a common language." No one knows exactly who said this, but it reflects the
way many Brits feel about American English.

## Pronunciation

There are many pronunciation differences between American and British English.
Typically, the differences are in vowel sounds, consonant sounds, stress and
intonation.

Vlowel differences:

- In British English, the letter `a` is pronounced as /ɑː/ in words like
  `bath`, `dance` and `laugh`. In American English, it is pronounced as /æ/.
- In British English, the letter `i` is pronounced as /ɪ/ in words like `either`
  and `neither`. In American English, it is pronounced as /aɪ/.
- In British English, the letter `o` is pronounced as /ɒ/ in words like `hot`
  and `not`. In American English, it is pronounced as /ɑː/.
- In British English, the letter `o` is pronounced as /əʊ/ in words like `go`
  and `home`. In American English, it is pronounced as /oʊ/.
- In British English, the letter `u` is pronounced as /juː/ in words like
  `new` and `music`. In American English, it is pronounced as /uː/.

Other differences:

- In British English, the letter `r` is pronounced only when it is followed by
  a vowel sound. In American English, the letter `r` is pronounced in all
  positions. For example, the word `car` is pronounced as /kɑː/ in British
  English, but /kɑːr/ in American English.
- In British English, the letter `t` is pronounced as a clear /t/ sound. In
  American English, it is often pronounced as a flap /ɾ/ sound, which sounds
  similar to a quick /d/ sound. For example, the word `better` is pronounced
  as /ˈbɛtə/ in British English, but /ˈbɛɾər/ in American English.
- In British English, the letter `l` is pronounced as a clear /l/ sound. In
  American English, it is often pronounced as a dark /ɫ/ sound, which is
  pronounced with the back of the tongue raised. For example, the word `milk`
  is pronounced as /mɪlk/ in British English, but /mɪɫk/ in American English.
- In British English, the letter `h` is pronounced in all positions. In American
  English, it is often silent at the beginning of words. For example, the word
  `herb` is pronounced as /hɜːb/ in British English, but /ɜːrb/ in American
  English.
- In British English, the `ee` is pronounced as /iː/ in words like `been`
  and `leisure`. In American English, it is pronounced as /ɪn/ and /ɪʒɚ/,
  respectively.
- In British English, the `y` is pronounced as /ɪː/ in words like `family`,
  `economy`, `bravery` and `technology`. In American English, it is pronounced
  as /iː/.

## Grammar

There are a few grammatical differences between the two varieties of English.

### Collective nouns

Singular in American English, but in British English, it can be singular
or plural.

- The team is good / The team are(is) playing tonight

### Auxiliary verbs

Auxiliary verbs, also known as helping verbs, are verbs that help form a
grammatical function. They "help" the main verb by adding information about
time, modality and voice.

- "I will go home now." / "I shall go home now."
- "Should we go now?" / "Shall we go now?"
- "You do not need to come to work today." / "You needn't come to work today."

### Past tense verbs

There are some small differences with past forms of irregular verbs.

Americans tend to use the `–ed` ending; Brits tend to use the `-t` ending:

- burned / burned or burnt
- dreamed / dreamed or dreamt
- learned / learned or learnt

In the past participle form, Americans tend to use the `–en` ending for some
irregular verbs. Americans use both got and gotten in the past participle.
Brits only use got.

- "I have never gotten caught." / "I have never got caught."

### Tag questions

A tag question is a grammatical form that turns a statement into a question.
For example, "The whole situation is unfortunate, isn't it?" or, "You don’t
like him, do you?"

The tag includes a pronoun and its matching form of the verb be, have or do.
Tag questions encourage people to respond and agree with the speaker. Americans
use tag questions, too, but less often than Brits.
