There is an old saying that America and Britain are "two nations divided by
a common language." No one knows exactly who said this, but it reflects the
way many Brits feel about American English.

## Grammar

There are a few grammatical differences between the two varieties of English.

### Collective nouns

Singular in American English, but in British English, it can be singular
or plural.

- The team is good / The team are(is) playing tonight

### Auxiliary verbs

Auxiliary verbs, also known as helping verbs, are verbs that help form a
grammatical function. They "help" the main verb by adding information about
time, modality and voice.

- "I will go home now." / "I shall go home now."
- "Should we go now?" / "Shall we go now?"
- "You do not need to come to work today." / "You needn't come to work today."

### Past tense verbs

There are some small differences with past forms of irregular verbs.

Americans tend to use the `–ed` ending; Brits tend to use the `-t` ending:

- burned / burned or burnt
- dreamed / dreamed or dreamt
- learned / learned or learnt

In the past participle form, Americans tend to use the `–en` ending for some
irregular verbs. Americans use both got and gotten in the past participle.
Brits only use got.

- "I have never gotten caught." / "I have never got caught."

### Tag questions

A tag question is a grammatical form that turns a statement into a question.
For example, "The whole situation is unfortunate, isn't it?" or, "You don’t
like him, do you?"

The tag includes a pronoun and its matching form of the verb be, have or do.
Tag questions encourage people to respond and agree with the speaker. Americans
use tag questions, too, but less often than Brits.
