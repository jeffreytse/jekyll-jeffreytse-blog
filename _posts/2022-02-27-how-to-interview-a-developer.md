How to interview a developer? This is a very common problem. Different people
have different criteria for judging. Here is a mathematical method for me to
score a developer quantitatively, so that we can roughly compare the quality
of different developers based on the numbers.

## Quantitative Table

| Item                       | Remark                                             | Weight (1-5) |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :----------: |
| CS Basic Knowledge         | OS? Network? Language? Framework? Code Style?      |      5       |
| Data Structure + Algorithm | Basic DSA is necessary, DP/Tree/Graph?             |      4       |
| Project Experience         | Open-source? interesting? Valuable? Match the job? |      4       |
| Job/Education Experience   | Well-known companies/schools are preferred.        |      2       |
| Clever                     | Self-study? Self-driven? Good at taking notes?     |      2       |
| Character                  | Perseverance? Passionate about tech?               |      1       |
| Teamwork                   | Comunication? Cooperation? Management?             |      1       |
| Others                     | Award? Hoby? Geek?                                 |      1       |

- For a senior candidate, his thinking and answers should be systematically.

## Assessment

- 80 < score <= 100 - **Excellent**
- 65 < score <= 80 - **Very good**
- 50 < score <= 65 - **Can be considered**
- 25 < score <= 50 - **Relatively Worse**
- 0 < score <= 25 - **Extremely Worse**
