How to interview a developer? This is a very common problem. Different people
have different criteria for judging. Here is a mathematical method for me to
score a developer quantitatively, so that we can roughly compare the quality
of different developers based on the scores.

## Quantitative Table

| Item                       | Remark                                                | Weight (1-5) |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------: |
| CS Basic Knowledge         | OS? Network? Language? Framework? Code Style?         |      5       |
| Data Structure + Algorithm | Basic DSA is necessary, DP/Tree/Graph?                |      4       |
| Project Experience         | Open-source? interesting? Valuable? Match the job?    |      4       |
| Job/Education Experience   | Well-known companies/schools are preferred.           |      2       |

| Teamwork                   | Communication? Cooperation? Management?               |      1       |
| Others                     | Award? Hobby? Geek?                                   |      1       |

For an interviewer, the important are:

- Read the candidate's resume carefully and annotate it before the interview.
- Be like a friend, you can get to know a real and natural performance
  of candidate.
- Give the candidate more time to talk about his experience and demonstrate
  his abilities.
- Be careful to guide candidates, as most candidates don't know exactly what
  they need to show.
- ...

For a candidate, the important are:

- The ability of systematical thinking.
- The ability to find knowledge and digest knowledge.
- The mindset of problem-solving.
- The ability to use existing resources like software.
- The ability of communication and teamwork.
- ...

## Assessment

- 80 < score <= 100 - **Excellent**
- 65 < score <= 80 - **Very good**
- 50 < score <= 65 - **Can be considered**
- 25 < score <= 50 - **Relatively Worse**
- 0 < score <= 25 - **Extremely Worse**
