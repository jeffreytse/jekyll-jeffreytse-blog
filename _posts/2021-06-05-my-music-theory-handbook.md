This handbook is a topically organized book of reference on music theory that
I learned.

## Melody

- Melody is the soul of music
- There're many ways to write a melody
- It's complicated as many factors to consider
  - The theme of music
  - The characteristics of the audience
  - The emotions that it wants to express

### Interval Melody

What the duration is?

- The time a pitch continues

What an interval is?

- A term to describe the pitch gap
- The distance between two pitches
- Unit is degree

For example:

- C->C: 1 degree
- C->D: 2 degrees
- D->E: 2 degrees
- C->E: 3 degrees

Interval classification:

- Homophonic Repetition (1 degree)
- Progressive Progress (2 degrees)
- Jumping Progress (3 degrees or higher)
  - A small jump (3 degrees)
  - A big jump (3+ degrees)

Interval restriction:

- 1-3 degrees: unrestricted
- 4+ degrees: Be cautious, not too frequent
- 6+ degrees: Must be reversed

Reference specification:

- Range within 12 degrees
  - performance
  - singing
  - sounds lacking in coherence
- Stagger interval classes
  - Keep active
  - Keep stable

Pros and cons:

- Doesn't require inspiration or creativity
- Can randomly write many non-repetitive melodies
- It's possible to write a very bad music if without adjustment
  - Must be modified and adjusted after it is written.

### Four development trends of melody

What the tension is? Describe the intensity of the music and melody.

- The tension of melody
  - Accumulating tension
    - After the tension is accumulated, it must be released in some way
  - Releasing tension
  - Push music forward
- Four development trends
  - Ascending Progress (Accumulating tension)
  - Descending Progress (Releasing tension)
  - Staggered Progress (Keeping tension)
  - Quiescent Progress (Keeping tension)

The rule of accumulation and release of tension:

- Through the pitch of the notes
  - Pitch rise (Accumulating tension)
  - Pitch drop (Release tension)
- Through the length of the notes
  - Short notes (Accumulating tension)
  - Long notes (Release tension)

## Harmony

### Harmony functions

What the chord is?

In Harmonics:

- Two or more sound are emitted at the same time
- The functions and features of sound (good or not, bright or dim, nervous or
  smoothing, what function does it play in music development, etc.)
- Classify, organize and study the characteristics and functions in different ways

Objectively speaking, there is a big difference between playing one note and
playing multiple notes at the same time.

After combining the notes. the sound can be:

- Sunny or Soft
- Uncomfortable
- Special effects or interesting feeling

### Triad

- The simplest chord among all the chords in harmonics
- A chord composed of three notes superimposed in thirds
- Root, third and fifth

Understand the interval deeply:

Since classification method of degrees is a bit rough

For example:

- C -> D: 2 degrees (A black key of c#, a whole tone)
- E -> F: 2 degrees (No black key, semitone)

Both are 2 degrees, but the intervals are different, which is inaccurate, to
solve this problem, we add prefixes to them.

| Degrees | Semitones | Short    |
| ------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1       | 0         | P1       |
| 2       | 1         | m2 or A1 |
| ^^      | 2         | M2 or d3 |
| 3       | 3         | m3       |
| ^^      | 4         | M3       |
| 4       | 5         | P4       |
| ^^      | 6         | A4 or d5 |
| 5       | 7         | P5       |
| ^^      | 8         | m6       |
| 6       | 9         | M6       |
| ^^      | 10        | m7       |
| 7       | 11        | M7       |
| 8       | 12        | P8       |

Prefix meanings:

- P: Perfect
- A: Augmented
- d: Diminished
- m: Minor
- M: Major

The classification of triads:

- Major Triad (M3 + m3, bright, happy, vivid, optimistic)
- Minor Triad (m3 + M3, dim, sad, lifeless, hesitate)
- Augmented Triad (M3 + M3, uncomfortable)
- Diminished Triad (m3 + m3, uncomfortable)

There're many ways to express chord, the most commonly used are the below three
ways:

- Symbols(The English alphabet of phonetic names)
  - The most commonly used notation in jazz and modern pop music
  - The letter of root note + the characteristics of the chord
    - C or Cmaj
    - Cm or Cmin
    - C+ or Caug
    - C^o or Cdim
- Roman Numerals
  - The most commonly used notation in classical music
  - The uppercase or lowercase Roman numerals + the characteristics of the cord
    - I
    - i
    - I+
    - i^o
- Figured Bass Notation
  - Focuses on recording the transposition and interval relationship of music

The classification of harmony functions:

- Tonic function (T)
  - Very stable, smooth, relaxing and satisfying feeling
  - Plays a role to start or stop music (just as your home)
  - At the beginning and end of a piece of music
  - I, iii, vi
    - I is the most typical one
    - iii and vi are relatively weak in functionality (A temporary home like
      hotel, )
  - Disadvantage
    - Too stable
    - Boring and no development
    - Needs other function chords to help it
- Dominant function (D)
  - Unstable
  - Strongly want to continue to develop, and eventually return to the Tonic
    function (outside)
  - Be interspersed in the development of music
  - V, vii^o
    - V is the most typical one (V7 is stronger than V)
    - Vii^o and vi are relatively weak in functionality
- Subdominant function (S)
  - Not so stable, but not particularly unstable (T < S < D)
  - As the bridge, let the chord connections become diverse (Bridge between home
    and outside)
  - IV, ii
    - IV is the most typical one
    - ii is relatively weak in functionality

The role of harmony functions:

- A guide to write the harmonic progression
- Push music forward

The progress is as below:

(Unstable) --(Resolution)--> (Stable)

### Harmony progression

It's written using the logic of functional harmony

Different types of Functional Progression:

- Functional progression
  - Starting with the T
  - Sequential connection
    - T -> T/D/S
    - S -> T/D/S
    - D -> T (D is quite tense to return to be stable)
  - C -> F -> G7 -> C
    - In Chinese: 启 -> 承 -> 转 -> 合
- Termination progression
  - Plagal Cadence progression
- Sequence progression
- Non-functional progression (with non-functional harmony, focus on the
  environment and which harmony can express it)

### Notation Systems

| Note name | Solfège name | function name              |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| C         | Do           | Tonic                      |
| D         | Re           | Supertonic                 |
| E         | Mi           | Mediant                    |
| F         | Fa           | Subdominant                |
| G         | So(Sol)      | Dominant                   |
| A         | La           | Submediant                 |
| B         | Si(Ti)       | Subtonic (or leading tone) |
| C         | Do           | Tonic                      |

For the Solfège:

- Movable do
- Fixed do
