ORID is an acronym for Objective, Reflective, Interpretational and Decisional.
It's a thinking framework that enables a focused conversation in order to reach
some point of agreement or clarify differences.

## What's ORID?

It was developed by the Institute of Cultural Affairs (ICA) in Canada and
involves a facilitator asking people four levels of questioning with each level
building on previous levels. Through four levels of step-by-step questions, the
respondent is guided to think deeply about the appearance of things and finally
make behavioral decisions.

- **(O)bjective**: what do we know? (Facts)
- **(R)eflective**: how does it make us feel? (Feeling)
- **(I)nterpretive**: what does it mean for us? (Thinking)
- **(D)ecisional**: what are we going to do? (Decision)

Furthermore, ORID, also known as the Ring of Awareness, is a classic personal
review model that is very practical in personal review and work summary, and
helps individuals grow faster and escape from a state of confusion.

## How to use it?

Here is an example for you to quickly grab it well.

- **O**: One day I met a vicious dog on the way home.
- **R**: I feel very scared, worried that I will be bitten.
- **I**: Should I go through hard or take a detour?
- **D**: In the end I decided to take a detour.

## Conclusion

Although ORID originated from artistic conversation, it has the same underlying
thinking logic as many other well-known learning frameworks.
