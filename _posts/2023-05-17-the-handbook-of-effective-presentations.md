## Introduction

When preparing a presentation, you must be clear about your goals and objectives
and how they relate to the needs of your audience. Consider also what action you
want your audience to take and focus your presentation on what will most
effectively persuade them to take that action.

## Three Major Elements

Here, we introduce the three major elements you must include to create an
effective presentation.

- Why: Goals and objectives
- Who: Your target audience
- How: Call to action

### Why?

Generally, the goals and objectives of your presentation represent your desired
outcomes and what you are trying to communicate. Your goal for one presentation
may simply be to inform or educate your audience but for another, it might be to
inspire or motivate. Goals typically explain "why" your presentation will be
important.

How do you discuss your goals and objectives in your presentation? It should be
included at the start of your presentation in bullet form, and it should be
short and succinct, these allow them to quickly understand your intention while
demonstrating what are you trying to achieve.

How could these considerations of goals and objectives also be incorporated into
other aspects of entrepreneurship and starting a small business? Some other
examples of where these considerations come into play include:

- Business communications
- Advertising
- Social media and web marketing
- Social impact
- Sales and customer relationship management

### Who?

Your target audience refers to the demographic that you are aiming to persuade,
educate, or inspire with your presentation. Your target audience represents the
"who" of your presentation.

What role does your target audience play in a presentation? It's so important
for you to consider who you seek to influence with the information shared in
your presentation. Understanding this will inform your style of writing and
storytelling, and it will establish your pace and help you design your
presentation. Take time to brainstorm what the intended audience cares about and
incorporate those points into your presentation.

### How?

The call to action is arguably the most important part of your presentation. It
typically comes at the end and clearly de?nes what you are asking your audience
to do and how you want them to take action. The call to action represents the
"how" variable and describes how your audience can take the information you’ve
shared in your presentation and use it.

What is so important about call to action at the end of a presentation? The call
to action is the moment that the audience has been waiting for. It describes
what you need from them. Your call to action helps to galvanize people around
your intention. You always want to have a slide that specifically maps out what
you need or how the audience will use what they learned in your presentation.
When creating your call to action, you must ask yourself, how can the audience
take the information and use it? As you progress through your talking points,
you are working to deepen the audience's understanding and investment in your
message. Make your ask, as you near the end of your presentation. Do it humbly
but boldly. Trust that what you have to say has meaning and the right people
will feel the same.

## Identify Your Target Audience

When developing, practicing, and eventually giving your presentation, it is
important to consider what content and type of presentation will support your
goals and objectives, your audience, and your call to action. Think about how
you will deliver your presentation to optimize each of those items. If your
content includes any physical or audio-visual supplements, be sure to prepare
those ahead of your presentation. Whether you are giving your presentation
remotely or in-person, careful planning must also be given to those logistics.

## Types of Presentations

Different types of presentations serve a variety of purposes and depending on
your audience or call to action, you may want to blend elements from different
presentation types to most effectively persuade. Below are some examples of
presentation types.

### Business Pitch Presentation

A business pitch is a type of presentation that is often used by entrepreneurs.
It explores how to align an innovative and marketable idea with people who can
enable the growth and development of that idea into a business. The target
audience for a business pitch may include those that can fund, support, or
provide other resources for that new business.

Typically with a business pitch, the presenter is expected to communicate the
amount of funding or support they are seeking to receive for their venture from
the funders, investors, and supporters in the audience. This is known as the
ask. When you are delivering a business pitch, you are building a case for how
your business will be successful. Conclude your presentation with your specific
ask(s) of the audience e.g. you are seeking $20,000 in funding to start your
business.

What's included in a business pitch presentation? Ask yourself:

- How would you communicate the need for funding?
- How can you effectively walk potential funders through your business model and
  share your unique value proposition?

As funders want to feel confident that you've done your research, you also need
to ensure you include:

- Any customer or market research
- Financials
- Any other relevant data

Remember, people invest in ideas and in other people. So make sure you tell them
who you are and why your business is important to you.

### Informative Presentation

An informative presentation functions to teach concepts to an audience that may
have differing levels of existing understanding of those concepts. The target
audience for an informative presentation entirely depends on the subject matter.
If the presentation is designed to have some basic level of instruction, the
audience may include people new to the topic. With the rise of video tutorials
across the web and on social media, informative presentations can offer
educational insight, teachable moments, and can also provide instruction on how
to improve a particular skill.

More often than not, an informative presentation will feature at least some
educational components. When that is the case, try to follow three of the most
helpful steps in teaching and learning. First, outline for your audience what
you will be teaching them. Then, teach them. Finally, at a summary level, remind
your audience what you taught them. This simple method of outlining, teaching,
and summarizing the presentation content will provide a dynamic learning
experience for your audience.

An informative presentation is designed to educate and provide construction,
what is unique about an informative presentation?

- Always start with your intention and think through how to inform and teach in
  an engaging way
- Think through what is the most relevant for your audience to know
- Why that information is important
- Be prepared to describe any nuances you want your audience to consider

A great way of doing above is starting off your presentation with guiding
questions and outlining what you want your audience to consider while listening
to your presentation.

### Decision-Making Presentation

Every day, we are presented with opportunities to make decisions with some
having a more significant impact than others. Decision-making presentations
typically involve multiple parties, or stakeholders, and begin by identifying a
problem and a goal. The next step is to collect as much relevant information and
data as possible about the problematic situation. From there, options for
solving the problem and meeting the goal must be evaluated to determine how each
stakeholder will be affected by the decision made. Once all options are assessed
throughout the presentation, a decision is made to implement the solution for
the problem. Note: relevant information and data can be gathered prior to the
meeting and included in the presentation.

When possible and prior to your decision-making presentation, brief some of the
known supportive audience members about the content and decision to be made.
Their support may be instrumental in terms of succeeding with your presentation
and decision making effort.

What's the importance of a decision-making presentation? The purpose of a
decision-making presentation is to guide your audience towards a position, where
they can produce decisions based on what they've learned. When creating this
kind of presentation, you should:

- First outline the problem you want the audience to solve
- Walk then through any relevant information that will help inform their
  decision. This can include:
  - Qualitative or quantitative data
  - Strategies that were implemented in the past and any results based on that
- If you have any recommendations that you want the audience to consider, you
  should include those as well
- Lastly it would be helpful for you to conduct additional research on best
  practices for decision-making processes when planing your presentation

## Professional Development

__You need preparation and practice__

It doesn’t matter what type of presentation you are giving, preparation and
practice are two key ingredients that will lead to your success. Try to rehearse
your presentation in front of a trusted friend or colleague and ask for their
feedback. Alternatively, video or record yourself while you practice. As you
practice, you may want to rely on notes, however, do your best to keep them to
one or two words at a time to be used to kickstart your memory. Trust yourself
that you can speak confidently and with energy on your subject matter. All of
these practices are also helpful for reducing nervousness about public speaking
which can be a very intimidating ordeal for some.

__What are some best practices for public speaking?__

When presenters are nervous or running out of time, they tend to miss key
talking points or they speak too quickly for their audience to effectively
understand and absorb what is being said or presented. This is a very common
pitfall when speaking publicly so it is important to practice speaking clearly,
audibly, and at half the speed you are normally comfortable speaking at. To
avoid having to rush through any material, be sure to time your practice session
to ensure that it fits within the allotted time. If you find that your
presentation is running over time, avoid speaking faster to include everything.
Instead, cut or modify your presentation’s content to make it fit in the time
available. If you happen to forget something or if you make a mistake while
presenting, the best practice is simply to proceed and move on as planned.

As you practice public speaking there are also some higher level actions to keep
in mind for when you feel more comfortable presenting. When possible,
acknowledge your audience. Thank them for their time, attention, and willingness
to listen to you. Be sure that your voice and body language dynamics are
appropriate for your audience. For example, making eye contact with your
audience or varying the intonation of your voice are both important tools for
listeners of many cultures and backgrounds, helping capture and maintain their
attention.

__A Note on Questions: Asking and Answering__

Any successful presenter will say that engaging with your audience is one of the
most important practices you can develop. One way to do this is by asking your
audience questions – ask what they know already on the topic and make minor
adjustments to your presentation and script to accommodate that. Find out what
interests your audience and see if you can pivot your presentation to reflect
those interests. Often, the best presentation is not a presentation, it’s a
discussion and sometimes, rather than asking the questions, you will be
responsible for answering them. If your presentation includes a question and
answer session, be sure to save enough time for it. Try to anticipate any
potential questions you might be asked and what your responses to them would be.

__Avoid reading your slides to the audience__

Sometimes people who are not comfortable with public speaking or are concerned
they will forget something try to compensate for this by putting all their text
on the slides and reading them to the audience. This is not a good practice. Use
key points and narration instead.

__How to create an effective slide presentation?__

You should consider 3 things:

- Audience
  - Understanding your audience will help determine how best to craft your
    message as you want to ensure what you share will be easily understood
- Intention
  - Have a clear intention is vital
  - Always consider 2 things
    - What do you want your audience to know?
    - Why does it matter?
- Pace
  - The pace and the structure of your presentation should feel as if you are
    telling a story, through words, images, and even videos
  - Each slide should be connected to your intention and structured in a way
    that deeps the audiences understanding behind your why
  - What you shared in your presentation should be succinct and include high
    level talking points
  - Know that your intended audience wants to quickly understand your goals and
    objectives as your audience wants to know why they are there, make sure you
    tell them from the onset. This help
  - Consider providing an outline or agenda
  - Clearly state
    - What you wish to solve
    - How you seek to get there
    - What resources are needed to meet your desired outcome
  - Remember, you get to craft the story, so keep it relevant and engaging
