How you would design a new website, mobile app or application? How would you
design a new car, toy, or camera? You may meet these kinds of questions in your
works or interviews. It’s not possible to assess every aspect of product design
process during a short time session. Therefore, it becomes very important that
how you think about user problems at scale, and turn that into a concrete
product(s) in a short time session.

## Why?

As you see, all the questions are either about improving upon an existing
product or thinking about a new one from scratch. It might be helpful to start
with a framework to get the right structure set to your audiences.

The key traits you should be aware and look for:

- Articulate an ambiguous problem well
- Be able to break down the problem into iterative and manageable steps
- Be able to solve core challenges for the users and being thoughtful about it
- Be able to reason your way through all your choices along the way
- Be able to understand whether reasons good enough for company to give a go/no-go
- Understand that everything is trade-offs

For clarifying questions we can use "__5 W's and H__" way:

- What is it?
- Who is it for?
- Why do they need it?
- When is it available?
- Where is it available?
- How does it work?

But sometimes we just use simplified version which is called "__3 W's and H__",
that is, excluding WHEN and WHERE.

## CIRCLE Framework

One of the famous ones is Lewis Lin’s CIRCLES ™ framework that lets you provide
a well-rounded and thoughtful answer. And it's a checklist or guideline on what
makes a complete, thoughtful response to any product design process.

- Comprehend situation
  - What?
  - Who?
  - Why?
  - How?
- Identify customers
  - Personas
- Report Customer Needs
  - As..., I want..., so that...
- Cut, through prioritization
  - ROI (Return on Investment) estimate?
- List solutions
- Evaluate trade-offs
  - Thoughtful?
  - Analytical?
  - Objective?
- Summarize recommendation
  - What?
  - Recap
  - Why? vs Others
