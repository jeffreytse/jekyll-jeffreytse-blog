How you would design a new website, mobile app or application? How would you
design a new car, toy, or camera? You may meet these kinds of questions in your
works or interviews. It’s not possible to assess every aspect of product design
process during a short time session. Therefore, it becomes very important that
how you think about user problems at scale, and turn that into a concrete
product(s) in a short time session.

## Why?

As you see, all the questions are either about improving upon an existing
product or thinking about a new one from scratch. The more you think about
users, the better you can define the problem and solve for those who need it
the most. It might be helpful to start with a framework to get the right
structure set to your audiences.

The key traits you should be aware:

- Articulate an ambiguous problem well
  - Who you are building for, why, and how it fits into the mission?
- Be able to break down the problem into iterative and manageable steps
- Be able to solve core challenges for the users and being thoughtful about it
- Be able to reason your way through all your choices along the way
- Be able to understand whether reasons good enough for company to give a go/no-go
  - Zoom out from your personal user needs and think about how this product
    could scale and provide maximum value
- Understand that everything is trade-offs
- Be good at well-rounded communication skills and deep sense of customer empathy
- Be concise and do not ramble
- Good at visualization like drawing wireframes

For clarifying questions we can use "__5 W's and H__" way:

- What is it?
- Who is it for?
- Why do they need it?
- When is it available?
- Where is it available?
- How does it work?

But sometimes we just use simplified version which is called "__3 W's and H__",
that is, excluding WHEN and WHERE.

## CIRCLE Framework

One of the famous ones is Lewis Lin’s CIRCLES ™ framework that lets you provide
a well-rounded and thoughtful answer. And it's a checklist or guideline on what
makes a complete, thoughtful response to any product design process.

- Comprehend situation (Clarify by asking clarifying questions on the mission)
  - What?
  - Who?
  - Why?
  - How?
- Identify users (Define the users and segment users)
  - Personas
- Report user needs (Go over user motivations)
  - As..., I want..., so that...
- Cut, through prioritization (Come up with user pain points)
  - ROI (Return on Investment) estimate?
- List solutions
  - Talk about the success metrics
  - Have a go to market or a rollout plan
- Evaluate trade-offs (Call out any risks and trade-offs)
  - Thoughtful?
  - Analytical?
  - Objective?
  - Risks?
- Summarize recommendation
  - What?
  - Recap
  - Why? vs Others

## BUS Framework

It's a three-step pyramid-like approach to tackle almost every product design
problem:

- Business problem/objective
  - What is the actual root business problem?
    - Company KPI is being affected
    - Revenue
    - Cost
    - Engagement
    - Impact
    - Monetization
    - Partnering with others
  - How do we know that’s a problem?
    - Low conversion
    - Lots of support calls
    - Poor adoption
    - Poor retention
- User problems
  - Which user problem is causing the business problem?
    - Approaches
      - User interviews
      - Ethnographic studies
      - Diary studies
      - Quantitative metrics
      - ...
    - Do drill down to really understand user problems
      - "Your site is bad" -> " clicked a button on my mobile device and the
        next screen was blank"
    - Present with a good set of data you've got (People Understand)
      - Personas
      - User Journeys
      - Flows
      - ...
  - Why is it a problem? How do we know it’s a problem?
- Solutions
  - Which idea will solve the user problem, thereby solving the business problem?
    - User tests
    - Interviews
    - Beta tests
    - Paper prototypes
    - ...
  - How confident am I that the solution will work?
  - The metrics to know the solution is successful
    - Adoption
    - Retention
  - Watch out for things (As you are not your product)
    - Confirmation bias
    - Plain old ego

With BUS framework, you need to tackle problem in that order. If you don’t get
the business problem right, your run a much higher risk that your final product
won’t be successful. But if your business problem is right, the only risks
you’re taking are with the user problem and solution. The same applies to the
user problem.

## Product Problems

The 4 most common prompts for a product sense problems:

- What is your favorite product and how will you improve it
- Build product X for user Y
- Company X wants to solve problem Y
- Improve product X

### Product Design

You need to combine a strong eye for design and UX with an understanding of
business problems.

Examples:

- Design a social travel product for Facebook
- Design a jobs product for Facebook
- Design a product to help users find a doctor on Facebook
- Design a better way to find roommates in a new city

### Product Improvement

The same thing as product design, but instead to improve and existing product.

Examples:

- How would you improve Facebook?
- Pick a Facebook app / any product — how would you improve it?
- How would you improve Facebook groups?
- How would you improve Facebook birthdays?
- What would you build to differentiate Instagram Reels from TikTok?
- How would you improve the peer-to-peer payments product on either Messenger
  or Whatsapp?

### Product Strategy

You need to understand competitive markets and to create a product roadmap that
responds to the business strategy.

Examples:

- Facebook events is struggling. How would you turn it around?
- Should Facebook enter the dating / jobs market?
- How would you monetize Facebook marketplace / messenger?
- What should Facebook do next?
- How to grow the product by acquiring new users and keep them engaged in the app
