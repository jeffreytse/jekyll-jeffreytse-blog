## What's up

Abstract and concrete are opposite concepts, many times we just know what they
mean, but don't really understand them. So today let us get to know them again
and have a clearer and deeper understanding of them.

## Abstract

An abstract is a brief summary of one or more things, there are two important
points here:

1. From one or more things
2. Find out the basic common characteristics

For Examples:

1. Man is an abstract of people who have common male characteristics
2. Human is an abstract of Man and Woman

## Concrete

A concrete is a definite or specific of an abstract, which means a concrete is
an abstract that is concretized. For examples:

1. You are a concrete of Human
2. Man or woman is a concrete of Human
